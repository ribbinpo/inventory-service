# Overview
InventoryAPI is a comprehensive ASP.NET WebAPI project designed to facilitate secure and efficient management of product catalogs and stock levels. The API provides robust authentication using token-based mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access its powerful features. Administrators have full control over product data, enabling them to perform CRUD operations for product and category management, real-time stock updates, low stock alerts, and historical stock tracking. Users, on the other hand, benefit from read-only access, ensuring data integrity and security. Leveraging Entity Framework for seamless data handling, the API also offers extensive search capabilities, allowing users to filter products based on keywords, categories, and price ranges. With a strong emphasis on security, data integrity, and clear documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI, InventoryAPI serves as a trustworthy and indispensable backend solution, particularly suitable for e-commerce platforms or applications requiring a secure and feature-complete product catalog and stock management system.
